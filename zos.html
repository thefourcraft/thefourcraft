                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">A zero-trust system is a cybersecurity strategy that eliminates implicit trust and continuously verifies every stage of digital interactions. <br>This approach is designed to protect modern environments and enable digital transformation by using strong authentication methods, network segmentation, lateral movement prevention, and granular, "least access" policies. In other words, a zero trust system follows the adage "never trust, always verify." By continuously verifying and authenticating interactions, a zero-trust system ensures that an organization's networks and systems are secure and protected against potential threats.<br><br>The goal of a zero-trust system is to create a secure and trusted environment for digital interactions, without relying on implicit trust or shared security assumptions. <br>By continuously verifying and authenticating users, devices, and networks, a zero trust system can help to prevent breaches, protect against potential threats, and enable organizations to confidently embrace digital transformation.<br></p>

                    Understanding Zero Trust Architecture</h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Zero Trust is a security model that assumes that an attacker is already present on the network. Instead of assuming that all network assets are trusted and can be accessed freely, a Zero Trust system treats all assets as untrusted and enforces strict access controls.
<br>
<br>The first step in implementing a Zero Trust system is to identify the most critical and valuable assets on the network. This can include sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information (PII) or intellectual property, as well as critical applications and services, such as a database or a web server. By prioritizing these assets, organizations can focus their efforts on protecting them.
<br>
<br>The next step is to understand who the users are and how they are accessing the network. This can include information such as the devices they are using, the applications they are running, and the networks they are connecting from. This information is used to create and enforce access policies that grant users access to the assets they need, while restricting access to other assets.
<br>
<br>In a Zero Trust system, access is granted on a per-user and per-asset basis. This means that even if an attacker manages to compromise a user's device or credentials, they will only be able to access the assets that the user is authorized to access. This can help prevent the attacker from moving laterally across the network and accessing other assets.
<br>
<br>The goal of a Zero Trust system is to create a highly secure network by assuming that an attacker is already present and limiting their ability to access critical assets. By implementing strict access controls and constantly monitoring user activity, organizations can protect their most valuable assets and reduce their risk of a breach.</p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">At IMS - Network, we were facing a number of security challenges that required a more robust approach. To address these challenges, I implemented a Zero Trust Network using Cloudflare tunnels and access policies. <br>This system allows us to secure access to our dashboards and management panels, ensuring that only authorized users can access these assets.
<br>
<br>To create the Zero Trust Network, I first identified our most critical and valuable assets, including sensitive data, applications, and services. <br>I then created access policies that specify which users are allowed to access which assets and implemented multi-factor authentication (MFA) to verify the identity of users before granting them access.
<br>
<br>To secure the network, I used Cloudflare tunnels to establish secure connections between users and the assets they need to access. This ensures that all traffic is encrypted and cannot be intercepted by an attacker. <br>I also used access policies to enforce the least access principle, which means that users are only granted access to the assets they need to perform their job and no more.
<br>
<br>Overall, our Zero Trust Network has been a success and has greatly improved our security posture. We have been able to secure access to our most valuable assets, prevent unauthorized access, and reduce our risk of a breach. <br>If you would like to learn more about how our Zero Trust Network works, I have created a demo that you can try out on my website. <br>You can also read about our experience on my blog.</p>
